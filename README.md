# Book Search Engine Starter Code
  
## Description 
This application comes with code but I refactor it to use GraphQl. Keeping track of what I'd changed and updated was tough because I was updating some of the existing code and forgot to delete some files so that threw up errors. Because there is a front end and backend and it uses react, I also had a lot of errors because it wouldn't pull the right mutations or query from one side. On deployment, I was having connectivity issues with mongoose and had to explore around more and decided to deploy with heroku instead of Render.
